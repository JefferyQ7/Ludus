# Configuration

The Ludus range configuration file is a yaml document that describes the virtual machines and optionally the network rules a user would like to deploy.

An example file is described below:

```yaml title="range-config.yml"
ludus:
  - vm_name: "{{ range_id }}-ad-dc-win2019-server-x64" # The name of the VM in Proxmox. You can use the `{{ range_id }}` template string which resolves to your range ID (i.e. JS)
    hostname: "{{ range_id }}-DC01-2019"   # The hostname for the VM. Note: Windows host names are limited to 15 characters due to NETBIOS
    template: win2019-server-x64-template  # The template that will be the base for this VM (`ludus templates list` to get a list of them)
    vlan: 10            # The VLAN for this VM. This number will be the third octet of the VM's IP and must be 2<=vlan<=255
    ip_last_octet: 11   # The last octet for this VM's IP address. Must be unique in the VLAN.
    ram_gb: 8           # The amount of RAM for this VM
    cpus: 4             # The number of cpu cores to allocate to this VM (can provision more CPUs than the host physically has)
    windows:            # This key must be set for windows VMs - all subkeys are optional
      sysprep: false    # Set to true to run sysprep before any other tasks on this VM. Default: false
    domain: # Define this key to put this machine in a domain
      fqdn: ludus.network # The FQDN of the domain
      role: primary-dc    # The role of the VM in the domain (primary-dc|alt-dc|member)
    linux: false # Set this to true for linux VMs - leave undefined or false for Windows/macOS VMs
    macOS : false # Set this to true for macOS VMs - leave undefined or false for Windows/Linux VMs
    testing: # This key controls the behavior of the VM in testing mode. If undefined, both values are set to true
      snapshot: true # Snapshot this VM going into testing, and revert it coming out of testing. Default: true
      block_internet: true  # Cut this VM off from the internet during testing. Default true
    roles:                  # This key is an array of user-defined roles that will be installed on this VM. Roles must exist on the Ludus server and can be installed with `ludus ansible role add`
      - geerlingguy.docker  # Arbitrary role name, as it appears in `ludus ansible roles list`
    role_vars:              # This key contains `key: value` pairs of variables that are passed to ALL user-defined roles.
      docker_edition: ce    # Arbitrary variables for user-defined roles. Do *not* use hypens to prefix these variables, the role_vars key *must* be a dictionary!
      docker_users:         # You can use lists or dicts here
        - localuser
    ansible_groups:         # Define the groups this VM will be a part of when `ludus range inventory` is run. These groups can be set after VM deployment with `ludus range deploy -t custom-groups`
      - customgroup1        # An arbitrary group name
      - customgroup2
    dns_rewrites:           # Any values in this array will be added to DNS for the range and return an A record for this VM's IP
      - example.com         # rewrites responses for this domain name only
      - '*.example.com'     # rewrites responses for all example.com subdomains but *not* example.com
  - vm_name: "{{ range_id }}-ad-win11-22h2-enterprise-x64-1"
    hostname: "{{ range_id }}-WIN11-22H2-1"

    ram_gb: 8
    cpus: 4
    windows:
      sysprep: false
      install_additional_tools: true # Install firefox, chrome, VSCode, burp suite, 7zip, process hacker, ilspy and other useful utilities. Default: false
      chocolatey_ignore_checksums: false # Set to true to ignore any checksum errors when installing chocolatey packages (for packages that are 3rd party hosted and update before the choco package hash updates). Default: false
      chocolatey_packages:
        - vscodium # An array of chocolatey package names you'd like installed on this VM. Default: none
      office_version: 2019 # The Microsoft office version you would like installed on this VM (2013|2016|2019|2021). Default: undefined (don't install office)
      office_arch: 64bit # The architecture for the Microsoft office install (64bit|32bit)
      visual_studio_version: 2019 # The version of Microsoft Visual Studio to install (community edition). Note: 2022 cannot target < .NET 4.5. Default: undefined (don't install visual studio)

# This key defines network rules in your range. It is optional, and by default all traffic is allowed
network: 
  inter_vlan_default: REJECT # The default rule to apply to traffic between VLANs. Default: ACCEPT

# These values control the values Ludus uses when deploying ranges and Windows domains.
